A Kanban-style task management application built with React + Vite + Bootstrap.
Users can log in, create tasks, move them across workflow stages, and manage productivity efficiently.

Features

User authentication (login/logout)

Kanban board with 3 columns:

Todo

Doing

Done

Create, edit, delete tasks

Drag and drop tasks between columns

Search tasks by title

Filter tasks by priority

Sort tasks by due date

Activity log tracking

Persistent storage using localStorage

Fully responsive UI with Bootstrap

Protected routes




Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite)

Styling: Bootstrap 5

State Management: React Context API

Routing: React Router

Testing: Vitest

Deployment: Netlify



How It Works

User logs in using demo credentials.

User creates tasks (they appear in Todo).

Tasks can be dragged:

Todo → Doing → Done

Tasks can be searched, filtered, and sorted.

All data is stored in localStorage.

Activity log tracks every action.

User can log out or reset the board.
